# DDmap
A Matlab Package for Solving the Double Digest Problems

It is the basic supplementary data of our paper entiled "DDmap: A Matlab package for double digest problem using multiple genetic operators" (preprint). With the purpose to keep the consistency of the results with that of in this paper, any modification from others should be at first send to wanglc2012@126.com, instead of editing this public project directly.

Note: Our all simulations in this project are conducted on a X1 Carbon laptop with Windows(TM) 8, Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4300U CPU@1.90GHz/2.49GHz and 8GB RAM. Softwares: MATLAB R2014a, MAPLE 2018
